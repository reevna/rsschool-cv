## About me
> I want to connect my future life with the IT and I want to be frontend developer. The main priority now is studying, I try to allocate time for training every day.
I take courses on Coursera and working on a website for my friend. I've just finished HTML & CSS courses and I'm currently taking JS course and learning about Git.

>I have a little experience in site administration.
During my work in advertising I updated information on websites ( www.poligonspb.ru and www.aerobutterfly.ru), added new pages, posted photos and articles.
Together with the designer and the manager, I developed the design of the site www.poligonspb.ru (initially it was without CMS, overloaded with complex technical texts).



## Code example
```
*{
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
    background-color:#f5f7fa;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-left: 20px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    padding-bottom: 40px;
    font-family: Montserrat;
}

.wrapper {
    background-color:#ffffff;
    display: flex;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    box-shadow: 5px 9px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

.sidebar {
    background-color:#1e2939;
    width: 370px;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-bottom: 40px;
}
```
